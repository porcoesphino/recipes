---

- *1 cup* rolled oats
- *1/2 cup* unsalted peanuts (optional)
- *1/2 cup* coconut
- *1 cup* plain flour
- *1 cup* sugar

Combine oats, chopped peanuts, coconut, sifted flour and sugar. Mix well. In a saucepan combine butter and honey and stir over gently heat until melted. Add the boiling water and then bicarb soda to the butter and honey mix. (This will bubble up so allow enough room in the saucepan or stir over the dry ingredients in case of spillage). Stir well together. Spoon small dessertspoon full of mixture onto a greased flat biscuit tray and bake in a slow oven approx 20 mins. Check after 15 mins. Loosen on tray while warm and place on a cake cooler. Seal in an air tight container.
