# Mostly Mandarin Marmalade

We like making Mandarin Marmalade which is sweeter than other marmalades but any combination of fruit is suitable. Using mostly Mandarin, one or 2 small oranges and 1 lemon works well with as many mandarins as needed to make your required quantity. (Maybe 2 kg) Traditionally Marmalade is more often likely to be Orange and Lemon.

Peel and finely slice skins of fruit of Mandarin, Orange, Lemon or Grapefruit. By peeling the fruit you are able to remove any excess white pith from just under the skin. Depending on the fruit selected, it is quite ok to finely slice the whole fruit cutting it into small pieces.

Add two cups of water to one cup of sliced fruit and leave in a bowl overnight. Cook until tender. (This will be approximately 1 hour). Leave aside to cool.

**Note**: 8 cups of fruit in a glass measuring jug (2 x 4 cups) requires 16 cups of water. This is the maximum a large stock pot can hold and will need great care taken while boiling. It is a large quantity of combined fruit and water.

Then add one cup of sugar for each cup of fruit. This will be at least 2 x 2kg packets sugar. Re-boil until mixture thickens. While cooking ensure you have glass jars with lids sterile. (The consistency of the jam changes near completion and the bubbles tend to slow down and also become frothy). Test jam by dropping a small amount onto a cold plate and allow to cool completely. Stir from time to time to stop burning. Pour into sterile jars and seal while still hot.
