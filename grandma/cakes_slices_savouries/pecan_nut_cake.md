# Pecan Nut Cake

Leanne made this as a gift for me many years back. Very delicious.

---

- *300 g* pecan nuts
- *200 g* glacé cherries
- *200 g* glacé pineapple
- *100 g* glacé ginger
- *2 tablespoons* flour
- *1 cup* shredded coconut (maybe a little less)
- *1* tin sweetened condensed milk

---

Mix all ingredients together. Place in a log tin lined with baking paper. Cook in a very slow oven for one hour.

**Notes**:

- Be careful to ensure the oven is very slow as this will burn easily.
- The nuts or glacé fruits can be reduced with some glacé Apricots used instead.
