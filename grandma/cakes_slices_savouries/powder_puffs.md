Beat eggs whites until stiff. Add sugar gradually, then slowly fold in the yolks (do not over beat at this stage as mixture will soften). Sift dry ingredients and carefully add to the egg mixture. Drop in spoonfuls onto a lightly greased flat biscuit tray. Bake in a moderate oven approx 20 mins but check after 15 minutes. Keep in an air tight tin. Add cream at least 1 hour before serving and sprinkle with icing sugar.
