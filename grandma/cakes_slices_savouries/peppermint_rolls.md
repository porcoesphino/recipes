# Peppermint Rolls

---

- *1 packet* Granita Biscuits
- *3/4 tin* sweetened Condensed Milk
- *200 g* Extra Strong Peppermints
- *2 tablespoons* good quality cocoa
- *1/2 cup*
- Coconut to roll logs in

---

1. Crush Peppermints by placing mints into a plastic bag and hitting hard with a rolling pin, meat tenderiser or hammer. (This can be quite difficult and time consuming.)
2. Crush Granita Biscuits until crumbs.
3. Add Cocoa to biscuit mix. Then add crushed mints and 3/4 tin condensed milk.

At this stage it is quite a sticky mixture.

Take handfuls and roll into a log shape approximately 8 inches long and roll in coconut. Set aside on a tray. Continue this process until all mixture rolled into logs. Place into fridge to cool. Next day (or when totally cold) slice into slices approx 1/2 cm thick. Store in air tight container in fridge.

## Variation

This same mixture can be used to make plain chocolate balls or Rum Balls. If making rum balls, add some rum essence to the mixture. Also use 2 tablespoons of cocoa.

With Rum Balls and Chocolate balls use a teaspoon to spoon amount onto hand, roll to shape and then roll in coconut.
