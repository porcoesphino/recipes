# Honey Crackles

---

- *1 tablespoon* of creamed honey
- *4 cups* rice bubbles
- *100 g* butter
- *125 g* sugar
- *1 dessert spoon* vanilla essence

---

Bring honey, butter and sugar to the boil for approx 5 minutes. Test regularly by dropping a drop of mixture into a glass of cold water. When honey mix goes firm it is ready. **Take care this can burn very quickly at this stage.** Add vanilla. (It will spit and bubble for a little while). Press mixture into a Swiss roll tin and cool. When cool cut into squares and allow to set until really cold before removing from the tin. (You can spoon the mixture into patty papers if preferred.)
