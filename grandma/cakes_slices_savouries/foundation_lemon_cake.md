---

- *125 g* butter
- *1/2 cups* sugar
- *1 cups* milk
- *2 eggs*
- *1 1/2 cups* SR flour
- *2* lemons (juice)

1. Soften butter in microwave 10 secs on high.
2. Pre heat oven 180 degrees for 20 mins.
3. Cream butter and sugar.
4. Add eggs – one at a time.
5. Mix flour and milk – alternately until blended.
6. Place into greased standard cake tin.
7. Cook in oven at 180 degrees C for 1 hour (less in a fan forced oven).
8. Mix lemon juice and 3 (large quantity) or 1 dessertspoon (regular mix) sugar (syrup).
9. Poke cooked cake all over with a skewer.
10. Pour syrup over cake. Leave to cool.

**Note**: If you wish to make a different flavoured cake you could use this cake and add Cocoa power to the mixture. 1 1/2 tablespoons to the regular cake mix and 4 1/2 tablespoons to the larger cake (x/s 3 mixture). This could be iced with Chocolate icing or slice in half and fill with whipped cream and then sprinkle with icing sugar.
