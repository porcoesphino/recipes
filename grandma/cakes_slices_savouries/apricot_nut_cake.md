# Apricot Nut Cake

---

- *350 g* Dried apricots, pre-soaked and sliced. (can use less apricots and add alternative fruit as this can be quite sour with little sugar being used in the mixture)

- *175 g* mixed chopped nuts
- *100 g* dates, chopped
- *75 g* desiccated or shredded coconut
- *75 g* butter
- *6 tablespoons* (90ml) milk
- *1/2 tablespoon* vinegar
- *3* eggs
- *100 g* soft brown sugar
- *175 g* plain flour
- *1 level teaspoon* bicarb soda

1. Melt butter and pour over the apricots, nuts, dates and coconut in a bowl. Toss to coat.
2. Mix together milk and vinegar – this will cause the milk to curdle producing a buttermilk substitute.
3. Mix this ‘buttermilk’ with the eggs, sugar, flour and bicarb soda until smooth. Pour this over the fruit mixture and mix well.
4. Pour into a greased and lined 20cm ring tin and bake at 160 degrees C for 1 hour or until skewer inserted into cake comes out clean.
