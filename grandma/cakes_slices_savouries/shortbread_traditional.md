Cream butter and sugar until light and creamy. Stir in sifted flours in two batches. When mixture becomes too stiff to stir, use hand to combine ingredients. Turn onto a lightly floured surface, knead lightly until smooth.

Press mixture evenly into greased 28cm x 18 cm (11 inch x 7 inch) lamington tin. Mark into squares or rectangles, prick with a fork, bake in a slow oven about 40 mins. Cut again into shapes. Stand 10 minutes in tin. Cool on wire rack.
