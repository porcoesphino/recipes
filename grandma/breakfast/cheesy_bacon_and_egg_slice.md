Cut Bacon into small pieces and cook in Microwave on a paper towel and covered with a paper towel, until cooked but not too crisp. Sprinkle bacon, diced green pepper over bread. Whisk eggs with a fork, add milk, mustard, Worcester sauce, mayo, pepper and salt to taste and fresh Basil chopped. Pour the eggs etc mix over the bread. Slice up the red pepper and sprinkle on top.

Cover dish with cling wrap and place in refrigerator overnight. Cook in a moderate (180c) oven for 50 to 60 minutes.

Serve in slices with grilled tomato or anything that takes your fancy. This is a good breakfast dish as it has to be prepared the night before and finishes off without any assistance other than cooking in the morning.
