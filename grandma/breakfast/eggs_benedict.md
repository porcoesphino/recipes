**8 Servings**

---

- *8* Eggs
- *8* English muffins
- *200g* shaved ham

- *1/4 cup* white wine vinegar (1/2 cup = 120 mL)
- *3* black peppercorns
- *1* bay leaf
- *2* egg yolks
- *125g* butter, melted
- *1 teaspoon* lemon juice

1. Poach eggs, in batches, in large frying pan of simmering water, uncovered, until cooked as desired; drain on absorbent paper.
2. Meanwhile, split muffins in half; toast until just crisp and browned lightly.
3. Place two muffin halves on each serving plate; layer ham on one muffin half. Top with an egg and hollandaise sauce.

## To make Hollandaise Sauce

Combine vinegar, peppercorns and bay leaf in small saucepan; bring to boil. Simmer, uncovered, until reduced by half. Strain into small jug; cool. Blend or process egg yolks until smooth. With motor operating, gradually add 1 teaspoon of the melted butter (it must be bubbling hot) to yolks; blend or process until mixture starts to thicken. Then, with motor operating, add 2 teaspoons of the vinegar mixture at a time, alternating with 2 teaspoons of the remaining melted butter, processing until sauce thickens and all butter an vinegar have been incorporated; stir in juice.

**Tip**: If hollandaise sauce curdles, gradually stir in 2 tablespoons of boiling water.

**Serving suggestions**: Substitute the ham with just-wilted fresh spinach to make eggs Florentine; serve either version with browned potatoes and a jog of mimosas (champagne and orange juice) or bloody Mary’s.
