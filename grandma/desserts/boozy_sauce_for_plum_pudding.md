# Boozy Sauce For Plum Pudding

This was always made by my lovely sister Ellen who always made the best Christmas pudding I have ever tasted. I will always think of her with making this sauce.

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring to combine well, then add egg, port and sherry, whisking for 2 minutes over medium high heat to dissolve sugar. Seal in a jar, allow to cool, then refrigerate until ready to serve. To serve, whip cream until soft peaks from, then fold into sauce.
