Peel, quarter and core apples, cut each quarter in half length-ways. Put in saucepan with lemon, sugar and water. Cook, covered, until apples are almost tender and still holding shape. Remove from heat, drain off any syrup and allow to cool.

Sift flours, custard powder and salt into bowl. Rub in butter until breadcrumb stage. Add sugar and mix. Make well in centre and add egg yolk and water. Mix to a firm dough, knead lightly. Refrigerate pastry 1 hour. Roll out just over half pastry and line a 23cm pie plate. Spread base of pastry with jam, and put apple on top of that. Roll out remaining pastry, brush edges of pie with milk, and cover with pastry. Press edges together and decorate however you like. Brush top of pie with egg white and sprinkle with extra sugar. Cut a few slits (I use a fork) in top of pie.
Bake in mod-hot (190C, 375F) oven for 20 mins, reduce heat to mod (180C, 350F) for a further 20-25 mins or until pie is golden brown.

**NB**: I always use raw sugar in this recipe. I think it has a nicer flavour in the apple, it doesn't really matter in the pastry, but because it is generally a bigger crystal it looks prettier on top of the pie, and is also a little crunchier. Also, the pastry doesn't seem to come together very easily for me. It always feels a little awkward and crumbly…..having said that I have never been good at making pastry, and although I think it feels awkward, by the time it has baked it is generally beautiful and is in fact my favourite pastry recipe and well worth the effort.
