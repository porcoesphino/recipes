Makes 2 dishes fortunately as you always wanted more!!!!

---

- *2* packets Raspberry Jelly
- *1* tin Evaporated milk – Chilled overnight**.
- *300 ml* carton whipping cream
- *1 tablespoon* gelatine
- *2 tablespoons* sugar
- *1 tablespoon* vanilla essence
- *3 tablespoons* (approx) of boiling water

---

1. Make jellies and allow each one to set in a flat Pyrex dish or serving dish.
2. Beat cream until stiff and set aside.
3. Mix gelatine, sugar and vanilla in boiling water and stir until gelatine dissolved. Cool but do not allow to set. (If not dissolved, re heat in microwave – allow to cool)
4. Beat evaporated milk until thick and slowly add in cool gelatine mixture. Spoon some of this mixture into the cream and blend. Then place all cream mixture into the remainder of the beaten evaporated milk. Blend carefully. Quickly pour mixture evenly onto the 2 set jellies. (Note: If you beat too much when blending, the mixture will flatten). Garnish with small amount of crushed Flake. **Recipe will not work unless milk is well chilled.**
