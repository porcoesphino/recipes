# Apricot Special Slice

This came to me from Leanne many years back.

---

- *1* large tin Apricots (drained and spread over a casserole dish with cut side down)
- *1/2 cup* Sugar
- *4 tablespoons* Self Raising flour
- *2 teaspoon* vanilla
- *2* eggs
- *2* x 200ml tubs Light Sour Cream
- *2 tablespoons* Grand Marnier (this is an optional extra for a slightly richer cake mixture)

## Topping

- *100 g* Slithered Almonds OR Cinnamon and Sugar

---

Mix all ingredients together and pour over the Apricots. Sprinkle with slivered Almonds. Cook in a Moderate oven for 30 minutes.

Spread with the topping and bake a further 10 minutes.

## Topping preparation

Spread with butter on top of cake mix and sprinkle with a mixture of sugar and Cinnamon. If making this blend from scratch, use 1 teaspoon of Cinnamon to 2 Teaspoons sugar.
