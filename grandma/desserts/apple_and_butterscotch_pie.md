1. Grease a 20cm spring form pan. Cut 1 sheet of pastry into 4 strips, lengthwise. Place a strip along each edge of second pastry sheet, pressing lightly to join, to make one large square. Ease prepared pastry into pan, pressing into base. Trim edges. Prick pastry with fork and chill for 30 mins.
2. Meanwhile, place brown sugar, syrup and butter in a large saucepan. Stir on low until melted and smooth. Simmer for 2 mins. Place fl our and spices in a large bowl. Add apple, toss to coat. Add to syrup. Stir to coat. Simmer for 20 mins, stirring occasionally, until apples are just tender.
3. Preheat oven to 180˚C or 160˚C fan. Line shell with non-stick baking paper. Fill with rice. Blind bake for 15 mins. Remove rice and paper, bake for 5 mins.

Spoon apples into pastry shell. Using a 4cm round cutter, cut about 30 rounds from remaining pastry. Starting from the outside edge of the pie, arrange rounds, overlapping slightly, over apple filling. Brush pastry lightly with beaten egg and sprinkle over caster sugar. Bake for 30-40 mins, until golden and crisp. Serve apple pie in wedges with ice-cream.
