# Pavlova (And Berry Fruit Option)

Aunt Maisie Pearson showed me how to make this special family favourite dessert.

- *6* egg whites (at room temperature)
- *1 cup* sugar
- *1 pinch* bicarb soda
- *1 pinch* cream of tarter
- *1 teaspoon* vanilla
- *2 teaspoons* vinegar
- *1/4 cup* sugar (extra)

- *300 ml* whipped cream

Add bicarb soda, cream of tartar, vanilla and vinegar to egg whites. Whisk egg whites for ten minutes while adding the sugar gradually. The mixture will become quite firm. Add 1/4 cup more sugar to make the crust. (Note: Egg whites straight from the fridge do not beat up well. You can warm the whites slightly by sitting the bowl over warm tap water for about 10 minutes after separating the eggs.)

Prepare 2 ways.

## First and main method

Spoon Pavlova mixture onto a large tray covered with baking paper. Flatten to required height approximately 5 cm high and 25 – 30 cm round with a flat spatula. Smooth the sides by turning the tray around as you hold the spatula against the Pavlova.

Cook very slowly for approximately 2 hours. Start at 150 degrees and gradually turn down the oven temperature. Turn it down 25 degrees each 20 minutes.

When cold top with whipped cream. Allow to stand a while as this will soften the top of the Pavlova. Decorate as desired – Strawberries always look spectacular, but my Auntie’s favourite topping is to add 2 x passionfruit to the whipped cream before serving and I used this more often than anything else.

**Note**: Do not be discouraged if the Pavlova sinks a little. It can be easily disguised when adding the cream and is generally not noticed once filled.

## Second Method

Pipe or shape into individual serve portions.

Before serving, fill portions with whipped cream and allow to stand for a while to soften the top edge of Pavlova.

Serve with a berry fruit combination make up of Strawberries, Raspberries, Mulberries soaked in Grand Marnier and some caster sugar. A small amount of orange juice may be added to get some syrup. Spoon this over the top.
