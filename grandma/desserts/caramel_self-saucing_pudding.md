Preheat oven to 160C. Lightly grease a 6 cup capacity (1.5 Litre) ovenproof baking dish. Place the sugar, flour, milk, butter, vanilla and eggs in a large bowl and mix to combine.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish. Set aside.

To make the caramel, place the butter, sugar and water in a small saucepan and carefully bring to the boil, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Pour the caramel over the back of a spoon to drizzle over the pudding mixture.

Cook for 35 minutes or until the pudding is cooked through. Dust with the icing sugar and serve with the cream.
