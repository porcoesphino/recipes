Very unique and came to me as an Italian Dish from the International Cooking Class I did when first married. Always been a real favourite with family and friends.

Crumble wafers in a very large mixing bowl. Beat eggs and sugar well together until light and fluffy ensuring the sugar is dissolved. Melt butter and chocolate in a double saucepan. (**Note**: this can be melted in the microwave if great care is taken not to burn the chocolate). Add butter/chocolate mix to sugar mix (**Note**: this will thicken at this stage) and pour over wafers and mix all ingredients together. Line a baking tin with Baking Paper allowing extra six inches at top of tin. Push very firmly into the tin and fold down extra paper and hold firm with a weight. Set in the fridge. Serve with cream and or ice cream.
