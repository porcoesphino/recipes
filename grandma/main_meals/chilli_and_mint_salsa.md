1. Lightly season the lamb cutlets with salt and leave to sit at room temperature for 1 hour covered with cling film.
2. Preheat the oven to 200C. In a bowl mix the sweet potatoes, sesame oil, red chilli and ginger. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a roasting dish. Pour on the measured boiling water then cook in the oven until just done, about 45 minutes. Once cooked mix in the coriander leaves and keep warm.
3. While the sweet potatoes are cooking make the salsa. Mix the green chilli’s with the mint, fish sauce, sugar, onion, lime juice and zest and the peanut oil and leave to sit for a least 30 minutes.
4. Preheat a grill, either a char grill, griddle or overhead grill and cook the lamb cutlets for about 2 minutes on each side. Blanch the sugar snap peas in boiling water, leaving them still crunchy.
5. Serve the cutlets on top of the sweet potatoes and sugar snap peas and drizzle the salsa over the top.

## Notes

- Brown sugar can be used as a substitute for Palm Sugar.
- Lamb Fillet can be used instead of Lamb Chops. Cook this whole and then slice.
