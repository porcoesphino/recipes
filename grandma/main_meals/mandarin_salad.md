Drain mandarins and pineapple well. (Note: This juice can be set aside to use in a fruit punch drink). Also drain sweet corn. Dice the green capsicum. Lightly toss all ingredients together (Note: With a slight modification, this dish can also be used as a dessert. Leave out the sweet corn and capsicum and add marshmallows and strawberries. Very delicious.)
