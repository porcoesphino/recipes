Spray a large pan with cooking spray. Sauté mince. When cooked, drain and place in a bowl, leave to one side. Add all the remaining ingredients to the saucepan except the tortilla sheets and cheese. Bring the mixture to the boil, simmer 10 minutes. Remove 1 cup of the tomato sauce mixture and leave to one side (this will go on the top). Add the mince back into the remaining sauce and bring to the boil.
Coat a quiche dish with cooking spray and lay 1 tortilla sheet on the base and spread with mince sauce mixture until the tortilla sheet is just covered, repeat this 3 times. Top with the last tortilla sheet and pour over the cup of sauce mixture you put to one side. Sprinkle grated cheese over the top. Bake for 30 minutes until heated through and cheese has browned. Rest for 2 minutes then cut into pie shaped pieces and serve with a tossed salad or steamed veggies.
