This recipe came from a low calorie diet booklet

**4 Servings**

---

- *400 g* Sweetcorn kernels, drained.
- *198 g* canned tuna in spring water, drained.
- *3* medium potatoes, peeled
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- *4 tablespoons* finely chopped chives, parsley and coriander
- *1* egg, lightly beaten
- Cooking Spray (oil)

## Salsa

- *1/2* cucumber, finely diced
- *1/2* red onion, peeled and finely diced

- *1* lemon (juice)

Preheat the oven to 180 C. Place the sweetcorn and tuna in a large mixing bowl.

Coarsely grate the potatoes into the sweetcorn mixture. Add the chopped herbs and egg and season well.

Combine the ingredients together using your hands and divide into 12 portions. Shape each portion into a flat cake and place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Spray with low calorie cooking spray and place in the oven for 15 – 20 minutes or until lightly golden.

While the fritters are cooking make the salsa by combining all the ingredients together in a bowl, Season well and chill until required. Serve the fritters with the salsa.

**NOTE**: I would just cook these patties in a frypan lightly sprayed with oil for a low calorie meal or in regular oil for a crispy finish.
