# Teriyaki Chicken Wings

This dish was always a very tasty favourite with everyone.

---

- *1 kg* Chicken (wings)
- *6 tablespoons* Teriyaki Sauce (Kikkoman)
- *3 tablespoons* sugar
- *3 tablespoons* oil (I don’t ever use the oil as I believe there is enough fat in the chicken)
- *2 tablespoons* soy sauce (Kikkoman)
- *5* cloves garlic (4 heaped teaspoons crushed garlic)
- *2* chillies (more or less as preferred)
- *4* slices of ginger (4 heaped teaspoons crushed ginger)
- *1 cup* water
- *1* sprinkle of pepper

Mix everything together with the chicken wings and leave for 30 minutes to marinate. After this time, pour everything into a saucepan and cook for 30 minutes or until the gravy thickens.

(Boned Chicken Drum Sticks can be substituted for the Chicken Wings and work well when sliced up before cooking. Chicken breast is usually very dry when used in this recipe).

Serve with rice.
