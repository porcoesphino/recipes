- *100 g* feta, crumbled
- *1/3 cup* spelt or wholemeal flour

Combine all ingredients and spoon into very well-greased mini muffin trays (tip, use silicon trays to stop muffins sticking or even line with patty papers - it is very hard to get these out of the muffin trays ). Bake at 180 C for 15 minutes.

**Note**: To add some variation, add some finely chopped bacon, small amount of turmeric and or curry powder.
