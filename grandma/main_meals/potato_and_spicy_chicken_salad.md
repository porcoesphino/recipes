# Potato And Spicy Chicken Salad (Or Beef)

This recipe was always a great favourite at Wellington House B & B when we served evening meals. It was partly developed by us after tasting a similar dish in a café one day.

1. Cut the meat into thin strips. Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat and add the meat, chilli, honey and cumin. Cook for 10 minutes, turning until cooked through.
2. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, leave to cool, then stir in the coriander (cilantro).
3. Meanwhile, cook the diced potatoes (and pumpkin/sweet potato).
4. Blanch the green beans in boiling water for 3 minutes. Mix the beans and potatoes together in a salad bowl.
5. Add the red capsicum strips and diced tomatoes to the potatoes and beans. Stir in the spicy chicken mixture.
6. In a small bowl, whisk the dressing ingredients together and pour the dressing over the salad, tossing well. Serve at once.
(It is OK to have all the ingredients hot and serve as a hot salad. In summer, this could be served cold).
7. Serve on a bed of mixed salad greens. Sprinkle with sliced almonds.
