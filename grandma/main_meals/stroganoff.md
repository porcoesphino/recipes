# Stroganoff

One of the recipes I first leant when doing the International Cooking Class when I was first married. Always very popular with the family. This recipe is quite different to a traditional Stroganoff.

- *1* large onion
- *125 g* mushrooms
- *3 tablespoons* wine
- *1 tablespoon* Worcester sauce

Cut up onion in small pieces and sauté in oil. Cut the meat into cubes and sauté with the onion. Add cubed potatoes, sliced mushrooms, chutney, Worcester sauce and wine, salt and cayenne pepper. Also add water and simmer for 1 – 1/2 hours. Just before serving add the sour cream. (Fresh cream can be used as a substitute). Do not re boil after cream has been added.
