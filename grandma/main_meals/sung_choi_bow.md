1. Wash and separate the lettuce cups, trimming to size if necessary. Cover and refrigerate until needed. You need to keep the lettuce really crisp.
2. Heat a little oil (peanut, rice bran or sunflower) in a wok or large saucepan.
3. Quickly stir fry the garlic and ginger for a minute or so, being careful not to overcook the garlic. Add the chicken breasts and stir, then add the mushrooms, adding a little more oil if it gets too dry, and continue to cook for a couple of minutes until coloured.
4. Add the shaoxing, soy sauce, oyster sauce & sesame oil.
5. Tip the chicken mixture into a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.
6. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the chicken, then the carrot, cucumber, spring onions, bean sprouts, coriander and lime zest. Squeeze a lime over the top, taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
7. Divide the filling between the 6 leaves and serve, garnishing with a little lime zest and coriander leaves.
