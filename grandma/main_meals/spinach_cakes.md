# Spinach Cakes

One of the recipes I first learnt when doing the International Cooking Class when I was first married. A great favourite in the family for many years.

- *1 lb* spinach
- *100 g* uncooked rice
- Salt and pepper
- *2* eggs
- *65 g* butter
- *100 g* grated cheese
- *1 tablespoon* flour
- *125 ml* oil for cooking

1. Wash the rice and cook. Set aside. Wash spinach and slice finely. Cook in own liquid taking care to avoid burning.
2. Put grated cheese into a mixing bowl and add salt and pepper and eggs. Mix well. When the rice and spinach are ready add to the cheese mixture and add butter.
3. Heat oil in frypan and then spoon in Pattie mixture. If not enough oil is used these patties may stick.
