# Chicken And Pasta Au Gratin

From Naoyo Yamaoka.

---

- *2* Chicken breasts (diced)
- *3* strips of bacon
- *1* onion, diced
- *1/4* medium sized Cauliflower (cook very slightly)
- *1/2 packet* pasta (depends on number of serves required)
- *1/2 cup* White wine or chicken stock
- Salt and pepper
- White sauce with nutmeg
- Grated Cheese
- Breadcrumbs and butter

---

Cook bacon and then add chicken pieces and onion. When chicken colour turned white, add white wine or chicken stock. Then add salt and pepper. Turn off the heat and allow to sit with lid on for a little while. Be careful not to overcook as it will be baked later. Make a white sauce using butter and nutmeg. Do not add too much salt as salt is already in the bacon and the dish can become too salty.

Cook pasta as on packet. Combine all ingredients.

Put into a casserole dish and cover with cheese, butter and breadcrumbs. Cook in the oven until slightly coloured.

**Note**: Any white sauce recipe can be used. If desired, this can be purchased ready made. Add a little nutmeg to the sauce.
